# What is DAC?

Discretionary Access Control defines the way in which objects are owned by their creators.  
It is embodied in the following quote:  

"You create it, you own it."  

If you create an object (a database, schema , etc.), then regardless of your role, you will be listed as an owner
of that object, and you can transfer ownership as a typical owner can.
