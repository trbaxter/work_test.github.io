# Snowflake ACM

This model combines the use of role-based access control (RBAC) and discretionary access control (DAC).  

Important parts of this model:

- Rights and privileges are granted to <ins>**roles.**</ins>
- Item ownership is granted to <ins>**roles.**</ins>

The details of an individual user **_do not matter_**! What matters are the ROLES involved.
