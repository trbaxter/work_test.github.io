# Authentication

This is the process of providing one's identity. This happens once per login.  
It only cares about <ins>usernames and passwords</ins> (or similar login information).

<br/>
<br/>

# Authorization

This is the right to access. It happens continuously throughout using Snowflake.  
It only cares about a user's <ins>role</ins>.

<br/>
<br/>

Be aware that authentication and authorization are **_SEPARATE_** processes!
