# Avoiding syntax issues

<pre>

When using string literal comments in SQL, you can avoid syntax problems
by utilizing single-quote escape characters.

`Mike''s cool code` = &nbsp; <span class="sf-red"> Mike's cool code </span> 

<br/>

The case is slightly different for Python, where a backslash is used as an escape character:

`Mike\'s cool code` = &nbsp; <span class="sf-red"> Mike's cool code </span>
</pre>
