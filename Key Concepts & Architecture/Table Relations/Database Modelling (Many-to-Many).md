<pre>
When working with a many-to-many relationship between two tables, 
a bridge table may be used to preserve data integrity. 

This is known as the <span class="note">Normalized Relational Database Model</span>.
(a.k.a. <span class="note">"3rd Normal Form"</span>)

Some characteristics of this model include:

- Different entities in different tables
- Information is not repeated
- Unique ids for each row
